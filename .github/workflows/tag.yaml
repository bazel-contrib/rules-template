# Tag a new release using https://github.com/marketplace/actions/conventional-commits-versioner-action
#
# This is easier than having to run manual `git` operations on a local clone.
# It also runs on a schedule so we don't leave commits unreleased indefinitely
# (avoiding users having to ping "hey could someone cut a release").

  # and releasing too infrequently which delays delivery of bugfixes and features.
