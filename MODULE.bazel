    # NOTE:
    # version = "",
    #
    # Always leave version unset or set to "" (the default). The default value
    # can prevent issues when the module is used via non-registry overrides
    # (e.g. https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_go/issues/4380).
    #
    # The publish.yaml GitHub Action sets the version in the registry to the
    # release version by patching this MODULE.bazel file in the pull request to
    # the BCR.
    #
    # For more info, see this Slack thread:

    # NOTE:
    # compatibility_level = 0,
    #
    # Bumping compatibility_level too frequently is discouraged because it's
    # very disruptive: as soon as a module is requested at two different
    # compatibility levels in the dependency tree, users will see an error.
    #
    # As such, the compatibility_level (1) should be bumped *only* when the
    # breaking change affects most use cases and isn't easy to migrate and/or
    # work-around, and (2) *in the same commit* that introduces an incompatible
    # (breaking) change.
